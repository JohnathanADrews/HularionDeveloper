## Using Hularion Experience (HX)

Document 1 - Getting Started https://github.com/JohnathanADrews/HularionExperience/blob/main/docs/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.md

The documentation for creating applications is in the Hularion Experience repository, https://github.com/JohnathanADrews/HularionExperience. I am also working on adding some sample projects. In the meantime, feel free to check out the sample Cardarion game. Use the release tag on this repo to get the desktop environment, and then follow the instructions below.

1. Clone or download the Cardarion repo. If downloaded, extract it into a folder.
2. In Hularion Developer, go to Package->View Sources.
3. Click Add Source. Enter a Name (e.g. "Cardarion") and paste in the full directory of CardarionHX subfolder within the Location. This is HX project folder.
4. Click Create.
5. Go to Packages->View Packages. You should see Cardarion, Cardarion Editor, Cardarion Core, and Cardarion DOME Import. Click Add on Cardarion.
6. Go to Apps->My Apps. You should see a line item for Cardarion. Click the run button. This should open the Cardarion application in a new tab.
7. In the game tab, Click the Play A Game button in the center of the window. This should bring up a game board with a draggable map, a minimap, and a hand of cards.

That's it. Cardarion is just the start to a simple web-based card game. It is meant to display the potential HX brings to make complex event-driven applications using HTML, CSS, and javascript within the HX framework.
