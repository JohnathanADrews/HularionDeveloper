<h1 class="header">Hularion Experience (HX)</h1>
<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hularion Experience is a web and web-to-desktop UI development framework. It relies on its own web assembler to build single-page applications from HX packages.</p>

<h3>Update 2023.5.10 - Style Categories reworked</h3>
<p>
    Style Categories enable many different forms of styles to be added and dynamically selected.
    Currently, this can be tested using the View->Select Style menu items form the main menu.
    To preview this, edit the About.html file and add or modify style tags using the "h-style-category-key" and "h-style-category-value" attributes.
    Then, select Tools->Refresh from the main menu. The styles will be added to the menu, and selecting them will update the UI.
</p>

            var t = this;
